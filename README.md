# Auto Intensity Generator for Guitar Games (Proof of Concept)

This project sets out to automaticically generate intensity (AKA difficulty) rating for guitar game levels. This is a proof of concept and will need to be reimplemented in other guitar game projects.

**Why is this necessary, and what are some of the benefits of an automatic system?**

- A big issue with the subjectivity present in existing intensity rating paradigms is that there is very little consistency. This can be seen in many other rhythm games as well, not just guitar games.
- With automatic intensity generation, all of the subjectivity is removed from the charter (level designer) and put into the hands of an algorithm. All charts, regardless of level designer, will be judged on the same, objective scale.
- Additional benegits include being able to unilaterally scale ratings in the case that the algorithm's parameters need to be updated in the future to account for a higher skill ceiling or unforeseen issues.
